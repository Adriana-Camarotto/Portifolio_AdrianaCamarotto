        <p>Hello! As a passionate about technology, I started my first steps studying logic programming during the civil engineering degree, which for many reasons I did not take forward.</p>
        <p>Years later, I went to university to do a business degree, and after it and I undertook in a start-up for five years. During this process I had a daughter, also passionate about technology. To help her, I ended up mentoring several teams for three years of the Technovation Challenge - a worldwide programming challenge for girls - even without knowing how to program, but with a good business knowledge.  And I was so proud of all my teams in special because those girls were coding and one of the team in 2018 was the South American Champion of the Techovantion Challenge!</p>
        <p>Well, well time flies and after immigrating to the UK, working in various areas, venturing into digital marketing, mentoring women's business, I ended up missing this wonderful world of technology and here I am starting my journey in programming with the aim of becoming a front end developer. And I can tell you that I'm loving putting my hand in the dough!</p>
